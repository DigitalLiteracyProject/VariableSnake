# VariableSnake

Team Members: David Wang, Jenny Nitishinskaya

Our game will expose students to the logic of manipulating variables to achieve an end result. The general idea for our game is drawn from the classic 'Snake' video game: players will manipulate a cartoon snake and chase mathematical operators on the screen to get an intial variable to a goal final value, growing the snake in the process.
